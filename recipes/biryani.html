    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic South Asian dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent but is now enjoyed worldwide.
            It is typically made by layering fragrant, long-grain rice with marinated meat (such as chicken, lamb, or beef) and 
            a blend of spices, including cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and saffron. The dish is often cooked slowly, allowing the flavors 
            to meld together and the meat to become tender. Variations of biryani abound, with different regions and cultures adding 
            their unique twists, such as using seafood, vegetables, or even eggs as the main ingredient. Biryani is known for its rich 
            taste, combining the earthy flavors of rice and meat with the aromatic and pungent spices, making it a beloved and popular 
            dish for special occasions and everyday meals alike.</p>
